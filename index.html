GIT is the most widely used open-source VCS (version control system) that allows you to track changes made to files. Companies and programmers usually use GIT to collaborate on developing software and applications.

A GIT project consists of three major sections: the working directory, the staging area, and the git directory.

The working directory is where you add, delete, and edit the files. Then, the changes are staged (indexed) in the staging area. After you commit your changes, the snapshot of the changes will be saved into the git directory.
